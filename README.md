# ShopCuAsp

This is a Book Shop mirror using Razor pages and boostrap.
Tried to make the authentication using the Entity framework but somehow new users don t get registered into the DB, thus I can t differentiate between an admin user and a client user.
In the admin menu, deleting a message doesn t work( even though the exact same code works for the books).
sibnjda@sdjgnsjdg.com  4d4eda4E!  for an easy login as Admin.
Tried adding some form of email confirmation after writing a contact message, but it didn't work.
