This is a Book Shop mirror using Razor pages and Bootsrap.
#Entity Problem
Tried to make the authentication using the Entity framework but somehow new users don t get registered into the DB, thus I can t differentiate between an admin user and a client user.
# Not working 
In the admin menu, deleting a message doesn t work( even though the exact same code works for the books).
Tried adding some form of email confirmation after writing a contact message, but it didn't work.
# Login as below or register(that works fine)
sibnjda@sdjgnsjdg.com  4d4eda4E!  for an easy login as Admin.
